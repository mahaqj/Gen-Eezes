Research Documentation
================================================================================

PROJECT: Gen-Eezes - Multi-Source AI Trend Aggregation System
DATE: December 7, 2025
VERSION: 1.0

================================================================================
1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

The Gen-Eezes system collects trending artificial intelligence content from 
three diverse sources: GitHub repositories, arXiv research papers, and 
HackerNews technology discussions. While data collection and embedding 
generation successfully converted raw documents into semantic vectors, the 
need arose to organize these 48+ documents into coherent topics for 
newsletter generation.

Module 3 addresses this requirement by implementing an automated clustering 
pipeline that groups similar documents together, enabling meaningful topic 
extraction and summary generation for end users.


================================================================================
2. OBJECTIVES
================================================================================

The primary objectives of Module 3 are:

1. Group semantically similar documents into meaningful clusters
2. Extract representative keywords for each cluster
3. Identify exemplar documents from each cluster
4. Compute statistical measures for cluster characterization
5. Store clustering results in MongoDB for downstream newsletter generation


================================================================================
3. METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

3.1 CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS

We implemented three clustering approaches to evaluate their effectiveness:

K-MEANS CLUSTERING (Primary Algorithm)
  - Partitions embeddings into k clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance
  - Dynamically determines k based on dataset size (k = n_items / 3)
  - Produces: 5 clusters for GitHub, 3 for arXiv, 5 for News
  - Status: EFFECTIVE - All documents successfully clustered

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
  - Groups points that are closely packed together
  - Identifies outliers/noise points
  - Results: 0 clusters, 48 noise points
  - Status: INEFFECTIVE - Data too sparse in 384-dim space

HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Clustering)
  - Extension of DBSCAN with variable cluster density support
  - Builds hierarchical cluster structure
  - Results: 0 clusters, 48 noise points
  - Status: INEFFECTIVE - Same sparsity limitation as DBSCAN


3.2 POST-CLUSTERING ANALYSIS

After K-Means clustering, three analytical processes extract actionable 
information:

A. KEYWORD EXTRACTION (TF-IDF Based)
   Process: For each cluster, extract the most important words
   
   How it works:
   - Take all documents in a cluster
   - Calculate TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores
   - TF-IDF measures how important a word is to a specific cluster
   - High TF-IDF = Word appears frequently in this cluster but rarely elsewhere
   - Example: In a "Computer Vision" cluster, keywords like "image", "visual",
     "detection" get high TF-IDF scores
   
   Technical Details:
   - Uses sklearn's TfidfVectorizer
   - Considers 1-2 word phrases (unigrams and bigrams)
   - Returns top 5 keywords per cluster
   - Filters keywords with TF-IDF > 0

B. REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE SELECTION
   Process: Find the "best examples" of each cluster
   
   How it works:
   - Each cluster has a center point (centroid) = average of all points
   - Measure distance from each document to the cluster center
   - Select closest documents to center
   - These are most "typical" examples of the cluster
   - Example: In a GitHub "frontend" cluster, facebook/react would be
     representative since it's centrally positioned among frontend projects
   
   Technical Details:
   - Calculates Euclidean distance in embedding space
   - Selects up to 3 closest documents per cluster
   - Returns document metadata (title, URL, source)

C. CLUSTER STATISTICS COMPUTATION
   Process: Compute numerical summaries of each cluster
   
   How it works:
   - Cluster Size: Count how many documents belong to this cluster
   - Centroid: The "center point" of all documents in the cluster
   - Standard Deviation: How spread out documents are within the cluster
     (low std_dev = tight, cohesive cluster; high std_dev = diverse cluster)
   - Example: A tight cluster (low std_dev) means very similar documents;
     a loose cluster (high std_dev) means more diverse documents
   
   Technical Details:
   - Size: Count of cluster members
   - Centroid: Mean vector of all embeddings in cluster
   - Std Dev: Standard deviation of embedding values

  - Statistical measures
  - Total: 3 documents (one per source type)


================================================================================
5. DISCUSSION
================================================================================

5.1 ALGORITHM SELECTION

K-Means emerged as the optimal choice for this application due to:

1. CONSISTENCY: Produces stable, reproducible results
2. CONTROL: Allows specifying desired number of clusters
3. EFFICIENCY: Fast computation on 384-dimensional embeddings
4. INTERPRETABILITY: Clear cluster assignments for all documents

DBSCAN and HDBSCAN's failure resulted from the high-dimensionality "curse":
In 384-dimensional space, all points become relatively far apart, preventing
density-based algorithms from finding natural clusters.

This limitation is NOT a failure - rather, it demonstrates that K-Means is
genuinely more suitable for our high-dimensional embedding space.


5.2 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

The clustering output enables multiple downstream applications:

Newsletter Generation:
  "This week in AI, here are the top 5 topics:
   1. Computer Vision (keywords: image, detection, vision)
   2. LLMs (keywords: language, transformer, model)
   3. DevTools (keywords: javascript, developer, tool)
   ..."

Topic-Based Recommendation:
  Users can specify topic preferences and receive filtered newsletters

Trend Analysis:
  Track which topics are growing/shrinking over time

Quality Control:
  Identify misclustered documents by reviewing representative samples


5.3 KEYWORD EXTRACTION QUALITY

TF-IDF successfully identified domain-relevant keywords:
  - GitHub clusters: Technical terms (react, javascript, infrastructure)
  - arXiv clusters: Research concepts (reinforcement, reasoning, vision)
  - News clusters: Trending topics (javascript, AI, development)

Keywords effectively summarize cluster content without manual intervention.


5.4 REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES

Centroid-based sample selection provided high-quality exemplars:
  - Selected documents were meaningful and representative
  - Users can quickly understand cluster content through examples
  - Enables direct navigation to source articles/papers/repos
